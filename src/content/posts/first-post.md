First of all, thank you so much for stopping by! This is my personal website where you can find more about my projects, hobbies and academics!

## Why?

Altough having a personal website/blog may sound like a simple idea, given that there are plenty of platforms where one can start to write their ideas easily, I always wanted to design my own website. Besides not having much success with previous attempts, since designing and building a website alone and self-taught from youtube videos is no easy task, I decided to give it one more try once I discovered that GitHub lets you freely host one website per account.

Currently I am in the second year of my bachelor's degree in eletrical and computer engineering and I decided it is time to start my own projects, giving me the ability to study more in depth and more pratically some topics that caught my attention. With that I'm creating this blog, where I'll be documenting my journey and share all the progress that I make!

## Website 

This website is built using [Astro](https://astro.build/), the posts are written in Markdown and all of this is being hosted on GitHub pages, for now. 

Thank you so much for stopping by, come back anytime if you are curious to see what I have been up to!
